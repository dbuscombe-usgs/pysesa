pysesa.pysesa module
=====================

Calculate spectral and spatial statistics of a Nx3 point cloud


Syntax
----------

You call the function like this::

  () = pysesa.process(infile, out, detrend, proctype, mxpts, res, nbin, lentype, minpts, taper, prc_overlap)


Parameters
------------
   infile : str
   	ASCII file containing an Nx3 point cloud in 3 columns

Other Parameters
-----------------
   out : float, *optional* [default = 0.5]
   	output grid resolution

   detrend : int, *optional* [default = 4]
   	type of detrending.

        1 = remove mean

        2 = remove Ordinary least squares plane

        3 = remove Robust linear model plane

        4 = remove Orthogonal Distance Regression plane

        5 = remove Savitsky-Golay digital filter, order 1

   proctype : int, *optional* [default = 1, no spectral smoothing]
   	proctype type:
        1 = spectral only, no spectral smoothing

        2 = spectral only, spectrum smoothed with Gaussian

        3 = spatial only

        4 = spatial + spectrum, no spectral smoothing

        5 = spatial + spectrum smoothed with Gaussian

   mxpts : float, *optional* [default = 1024]
   	maximum number of points allowed in a window
   res : float, *optional* [default = 0.05]
        spatial grid resolution to create a grid
   nbin : int, *optional* [default = 20]
        number of bins for power spectral binning
   lentype : int, *optional* [default = 1, l<0.5]
   	lengthscale type:
        1 = l<0.5

        2 = l<1/e

        3 = l<0
   minpts : float, *optional* [default = 16]
   	minimum number of points allowed in a window
   taper : int, *optional* [default = Hanning]
   	flag for taper type:
        1 = Hanning (Hann)
        2 = Hamming
        3 = Blackman
        4 = Bartlett
   prc_overlap : float, *optional"  [default = 0]
        percentage overlap between windows


Returns [proctype = 1 or proctype = 2]
