PySESA - a Python framework for Spatially Explicit Spectral Analysis

PySESA is an open-source project dedicated to provide a generic Python framework 
for spatially explicit statistical analyses of point clouds and other geospatial data, 
in the spatial and frequency domains, for use in the geosciences

The program is detailed in:
Buscombe, D. (2015) "Spatially explicit spectral analysis of point clouds and geospatial data", 10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.004, in press.

For the source code visit `the project github site <https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/pysesa/>`_

.. _setup:

Setup
========

Automatic Installation from PyPI::


  pip uninstall pysesa (removes previous installation)
  pip install pysesa


Automatic Installation from github::


  git clone git@github.com:dbuscombe-usgs/pysesa.git
  cd pysesa
  python setup.py install


or a local installation::


  python setup.py install --user


or with admin privileges, e.g.::


  sudo python setup.py install


.. _virtualenv:

Virtual environment
====================

You could try before you install, using a virtual environment::

  virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install numpy
  pip install cython
  pip install scipy
  pip install joblib
  pip install statsmodels
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install ift_nifty
  pip install pysesa
  pip install dask
  pip install toolz
  python -c "import pysesa; pysesa.test()"
  deactivate #(or source venv/bin/deactivate)

The results will live in "venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pysesa"


.. _manualinstall:

Manual installation
====================

Python libraries you need to have installed to use pysesa:

1. `Nifty <http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ift/nifty/index.html>`_
2. `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html>`_
3. `Numpy <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html>`_
4. `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html>`_
5. `cython <http://cython.org/>`_
6. `statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`_
7. `joblib <https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/>`_
8. `dask <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_
9. `toolz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toolz>`_

All of the above are available through `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ and `easy_install <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/easy_install.html>`_


Installation on Amazon Linux EC-2 instance
============================================

It's best to install numpy, scipy, cython and matplotlib through the OS package manager::

  sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++
  sudo yum install python27-numpy python27-Cython python27-scipy python27-matplotlib
   
Then pysesa using pip (which will install nifty, joblib and statsmodels)::

  sudo pip install pysesa


.. _test:

Test
======

A test can be carried out by running the supplied script::

  python -c "import pysesa; pysesa.test()"

which carries out the following operations::

  # general settings   
  infile = os.path.expanduser("~")+os.sep+'pysesa_test'+os.sep+'example_100000pts.xyz' 

  out = 0.5 #m output grid
  detrend = 4 #ODR plane
  proctype = 4 #Processing spatial and spectral parameters (no smoothing)
  mxpts = 1024 # max pts per window
  res = 0.05 #cm internal grid resolution
  nbin = 20 #number of bins for spectral binning
  lentype = 1 #l less than 0.5
  taper = 1 #Hann taper
  prc_overlap = 50 #50% overlap between successive windows
  minpts = 64 #min pts per window

  pysesa.process(infile, out, detrend, proctype, mxpts, res, nbin, lentype, minpts, taper, prc_overlap)
